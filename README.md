# Data-Visualization-Dashboard

## Task

- Use the JSONPlaceholder for mock data. Specifically, fetch data from the /users, /posts, and /comments endpoints to display user-related analytics

- Bar Chart: display the number of posts per user

- Line Chart: show the monthly comment trend based on the timestamp of the posts (you can simulate timestamps or create a mock setup since JSONPlaceholder doesn't provide dates)

- Pie Chart: illustrate the percentage distribution of posts among users

- Implement interactive filtering options to view data for specific users

- A `README.md` file in the repository detailing instructions on how to set up and run the project, along with a brief explanation of the project structure.

- A live demo link (optional but recommended, can be hosted on free platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify)
